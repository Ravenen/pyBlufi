# pyBlufi

Python utility to interface with esp32 Blufi component. Mimics 
[EspBlufiForAndroid](https://github.com/EspressifApp/EspBlufiForAndroid) 
and [EspBlufiForiOS](https://github.com/EspressifApp/EspBlufiForiOS).

## Why

Useful for testing/debugging Blufi commands without having to use a 
phone. Thus making it easier to implement new features, build on top of 
Blufi and not having to design apps and protocols from scratch.
